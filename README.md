## Play the game

Click on a card to start the game. Clicking on a card turns it over so you can see the symbol on the other side. There are always two cards sharing the same symbol. Try to find the matching pairs of cards. Once you have found two matching cards, they remain turned over. Proceed until all cards have been matched.

You can use the restart button in the upper right corner to restart the game.
